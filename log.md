# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Using grid line on css.

**Thoughts:** I never really tried to use 'display: grid' on my projects so yeah it's my first time, the thing about grid is it helps you design your app properly and it helps you visualize your app lmao .

### Day 1: January 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned columns on CSS3 and some tricks on ES6

**Thoughts**: I think i might use them on some projects and i think its better to use them than display inline hahaha. Going to read about nodeJs.

### Day 2: January 31, 2018
