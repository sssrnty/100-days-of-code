### Day 7: Febuary 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tryna learn bootstrap 4
**Thoughts**: My thoughts about bs4, i think you should learn it coz it has this "One advantage of using the Bootstrap 4 CDN:
Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap 4 from MaxCDN when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time."
