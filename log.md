# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Using grid line on css.

**Thoughts:** I never really tried to use 'display: grid' on my projects so yeah it's my first time, the thing about grid is it helps you design your app properly and it helps you visualize your app lmao .
